# Course Description 
Machine learning techniques are indispensable in biomedicine and healthcare as they allow us to gain mechanistic insights into biology or to create robust diagnostics to inform treatment decisions. This course will provide an overview of classical machine learning approaches and fundamental deep learning techniques that can be applied for robust, reproducible, and interpretable analysis of biological data. Topics covered include classical supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, cross validation, deep learning fundamentals, explainable and interpretable machine learning, and avoiding common pitfalls involved with training and evaluating models. All concepts will be taught in a practical way to readily encourage implementation and application of methods to biological datasets.

# Topics and Tentative Schedule.
Lecture notes will be linked here on the day of the lecture.

Of course the schedule is subject to change! :) 

# Course Requirements 
To obtain full credit, students must attend 80% [8/10] of the lectures, complete the two assigned homework assignments and achieve a passing grade overall. If any students believe they may
have to miss more that 20% of the lectures, they must discuss this with the lead instructor in
Advance.

# Grading 
* Two homework assignments: 20% each (40% total)
* Class Attendance: 60%

# Course Structure and Learning Goals
The class will be lecture-based, with the exception of a lab activity during one class meeting. There will be two practical, implementation-based homework assignments over the 5 week period. Students will have experience implementing and applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to biomedical datasets, evaluating model accuracies, and identify key features driving prediction in a model (interpretability).
